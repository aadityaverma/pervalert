# PervAlert

## deployment

`pyaudio` is a native python module requirement. It is recommended to install this from your package maintainer prior to installing other dependencies from `pip`.

- `sudo pacman -S python-pyaudio # Arch Linux`
- `sudo apt install python3-pyaudio # Debian/Ubuntu`

You must add the pervalert *service account* JSON key from GCI to the `/private` directory.
